1.0,"Nintendo Does Not Honor Warranty
","My son used this unit for 7 months.  At which time the unit stopped powering up.  There was no physical damage to the device.  Sent to Nintendo to have repaired, still well under warranty.  Nintendo responded that they would not repair under warranty, but gave no explanation.  Should give this zero stars.  I have been buying electronics and computer gadgets for more than 30 years, and never had anything this expensive (relative to its function) break so quickly, and not be supported by the manufacturer.  Beware, Nintendo makes garbage, and they will not warranty the garbage that they sell.

4.0,"Great product, Joycons need work.
","Everyone knows the switch is great. I waited a long time to get one because I was hoping they would release one with a better screen. That does not seem to be happening so I went ahead and bought it.However, 4 stars because the Joycon issue is real. The L button on the left joycon broke after a month. Fortunately, Nintendo replaced it under warranty but based on reviews online there is some build issues with the joycons in general. Makes me wonder how long the switch will last before I have to buy new parts.

5.0,"It’s one of the best consoles in the world.
","People of all ages who like games might like the Nintendo Switch. It’s one of the best consoles in the world. The Nintendo Switch has many fun games you can play.The Nintendo Switch has 3 Play Styles: TV mode, tabletop mode and handhold mode. It has a 6.2-inch touchscreen. It has battery life that lasts 2 to 6 hours. The Nintendo Switch is great for people of all ages who like games like the ones on Playstation 4. Playstation 4 and Xbox are similar to the Nintendo Switch. You can play and use the Nintendo Switch alone or with others.I got it this month. I wanted it because it looked fun, and I like video games. The Nintendo Switch is for me, but my family likes it too. It is easy to learn and use.  It’s durable; I dropped one of the controls but it didn’t break. I really like it; there are no negatives for me. It’s just right for me. I think the Nintendo Switch works really well, and the games are so fun.I think you should buy the Nintendo Switch.

1.0,"Defective Product
","I waited 2 years to buy a Switch because I heard about other people having defective ones when the Switch was first released. I thought that after 2 years they might have ironed out those problems. Ironically, right out of the box, my Switch has audio problems. Doesn't matter if it is docked, in handheld mode, with or without headphones, the same unbearable noise can be heard. It's static as well as weird audio distortion. I also had a minor problem with one of the Joy-Cons not sliding properly. It's under warranty so I contact Nintendo.Their tech support was very friendly and helpful. I was able to send my Switch in for repairs for free. They told me to send both my Switch and the Joy-Con in. Almost a month later, I get my Switch back. The minor issue with the Joy-Con was fixed, but the big audio problem still persists. The letter they sent with it says that they fixed the Joy-Con, but I don't see anything about the speakers in their letter. They just didn't fix it or didn't even attempt to as far as I can tell. I had to buy a ground loop noise isolator just to alleviate the problem and make the Switch bearable to listen to. But at least my Switch got all scratched up in the process, so I guess it isn't all bad (sarcasm, obviously). They even say to remove any screen protectors before sending it in. That was a mistake. I also packaged it in a box that was just the right size, wrapped it in bubble wrap, took all precautions necessary and followed their packaging instructions that they sent me. It wasn't a problem on my end. Good month long adventure for me.I've been a lifelong Nintendo customer since the SNES, have bought every home console since then except for the Virtual Boy (if that even counts), and have owned most Nintendo handhelds. My SNES still works to this day. A brand new Switch came broken on day 1. I would avoid the headache entirely. None of this was worth it.

","System crashed immediately. Error code 2168-0002, power off and if that doesn't work. Nintendo will need to fix it. Searched serial number on Nintendo's site, Ineligible.

4.0,"Switch is great idea, with near great execution.
","The switch is a fantastic console with a quickly growing library.Pros:- Region Free (plays games form any country, digital and physical)- portable with good battery life- HD screen on switch and upscaled when docked- ability to switch from handheld to docked mode seamlessly- Nintendo first party games are top quality- option for cloud saves and online features- expandable affordable storage via microSD (even 200Gb cards are cheap)- comes with all the parts needed for a basic docked setup- come sin a few colors/styles now- option to get more docks for multiple tvs without tying switch to a single locationCons:- screen digitizer is made of plastic... in 2019. This is a horrible design choice you WILL want a screen protector- the dock can scratch the stock digitizer, again get the screen protector- the top vents can be broken, the fins are too thin- the default internal storage is only 32GB which is very small for 2019...- early joycons have bluetooth de-sync issues, can be fixed but shouldn't need to be on a Nintendo product- User interface is kinda of bland right now and hasn't been updated since launch. It has no music, and only a basic black and white theme to choose from.Overall would recommend getting a switch but not without taking the proper steps to bring it up to speed (screen protector,  large microSD for games, and some docks to put on each of the place you might be sitting down to play)

1.0,"Not Worth it. Worst Console. Not Recommended ***
","Pros: Sleek, PortableCons:Not compatible with Wii-U games which you already spent hundreds of dollars buying the games and Nintendo expects users to buy fresh games for this console. Why Cannot you make a console which is backward compatible.USB-C charging port broke in Nintendo Switch.Joy Cons drift away and don’t calibrate.Why kids have to be online to play games ?

5.0,"The Family Console
","Best Family-focused console of the current generation. High quality first party games that everyone can enjoy. Much better online features. Smooth, fairly easy-to-use menus and online store. 1 year of online is only $35 for 8 accounts (current MSRP).The Joy-Con controllers have a lot of different ways to use them. One player can use 2 or Two players can use 1 each. Or you can use “pro” controllers. 8 players at once for supported software and games. The amount of controller options and accessories in the box is impressive.The Joy-cons are tiny. Adults and people with large hands will experience cramping and may have trouble with the L and R buttons. Joy-Cons currently retail for $70-80.The kickstand is janky. Be careful. It comes off easy, but goes back on easy. Seems easy to break also.Built in storage is not enough. Be sure to include the cost of a memory card with the purchase.Plenty of stories around the kids school about broken Switch screens. Be aware these are like tablets and kids often have accidents when being used as a portable device. Use beat judgement when letting young children take it with them.Recommended for FamiliesRecommended as 2nd console for PS4, XB, and PC gamers.Recommended for portable gamers

2.0,"Broke after using three times, wont show up on TV
","I have almost never written a bad review but very annoyed. My daughters used the switch three times, on third time it would not project onto the TV. VERY disappointed that we spent a lot money, to have it break right away, I spent much troubleshooting, calling store, calling Nintendo, and now I have to spend time and money packaging up the defective product and drive to ups store (scheduling a pickup costs $10) ITs being shipped ground which is slow. AND I have to send everything so we can't use it the time its gone. We bought this for a specific reason to use to entertain my younger daughter and now we don't have it.So in conclusion, the product breaks right away, I spent hours trying to get it fixed, I spent $$ but now without it for weeks, and I didn't get an apology, nothing for the inconvenience. When a customer is this inconvenienced by a practically brand new product and it is the companies fault, that company should A) show some empathy for the time and inconvenience lost by customer and their having to deal with disappointed children B) have the ability to offer a coupon off a game.  I am so tempted to just sell it once its returned and that could be hundred of dollars of lost revenue by Nintendo. Poor customer service is short sided.

5.0,"Its better than the ps4 and xbox
","First and foremost id like to say i did NOT buy it from amazon as i bought it off a local gamestop of mine and i would like to recommend some games and accessories. 2 Games you would like to purchase are Mario Kart 8 deluxe edition (60$) and Super Smash bros Ultimate  (60$) these 2 games will keep you entertained for hours and hours, accessories you would want to get are the pro controller, screen protector,case, and if you are good at opening stuff up get skins for it the screen protectors are usually 10$ and pro controller is 60-80$ the case is depending. The thing you're going to want if you are going to use this console not just for gaming is the two streaming apps youtube,hulu you can use these and its pretty good to watch stuff on it, Another thing your going to want to do if you have a family is buy more joy cons as joycons are needed to play games (obviously) so the joycons can come in 1 or 2 players you can use one joycon or 2.I hope you find this helpful!  oh and one thing is you can jailbreak this console (it can brick and is breaking the agreements)  but jailbreaking this console gives you more access like play snes games and many more just watch youtube videos for tutorials.

Glad I keep it on the floor but, feel like the floor shouldn't be the safest place for it...

","That joycon lock mechanism thing breaks kinda easily because of the plastic. (Broke in 4 days) they still work, one of them just easily falls off under certain circumstances.

Don’t let that discourage you from just downloading the game online though; there’s a micro sd slot on the back for extra storage.!

","To whom it may concern, Hi I’m a gamer and I am reviewing the Nintendo Switch. I got this Nintendo Switch on 12/24/18 and since then I been playing it almost 24/7. The Nintendo Switch is great and is sturdy but it could use some improvement for the stand. The thing I like about it is that it has good games. One of the games called Super Smash Bro ultimate had a lot of characters that I liked. I love how one of my games you can move it and you look around you. Another thing that I like about it is that it’s sturdy. Once I dropped it and it didn’t break at all. But it should have broke. When I touched the screen it didn’t get scratched because I have sharp finger nail. Lastly ,I love that it’s portable. I travel a lot and I can’t bring my Wii u to my trip. The Nintendo Switch will be great to travel and not worry about bringing my Ipad. To wrap it up, I really like my Nintendo Switch. My brother always plays one of my games on the Nintendo Switch.  If I could change 1 thing about the Nintendo switch is the stand. I would put the stand in the middle and make it sturdy.Thank you for your time,Josh

4.0,"I love my Switch, but...
","I have owned my Nintendo Switch for a year now. So I can give my honest opinion and all the pros and cons.Pros: I love that it can be played as a handheld or via TV so easily. With the travel case, it is easy to take on the go and continue to play my favorite games anywhere! I play during my lunch and breaks at work, if I travel for any reason, while waiting at doctor's offices, etc. I love the games, most being updated versions of what I played as a kid (Mario, Zelda, Pokemon)! I love all the games. The graphics are impressive as well. I like how different profiles can be made and the parental controls, so my son can have his own profile to play games that will not interfere with progress I've made in my games. The touch screen is neat for entering passwords, but is pretty much useless otherwise in my opinion.Cons: The joy cons are one of the biggest problems I have. Holding the Switch as a handheld for lengthy periods hurt my wrists and is very uncomfortable (but I ergonomic case helped this). The drift on the joy cons as they age is ridiculous, and the price to replace is outrageous! My other biggest issue is playing the Switch docked, there is no way to use a headset. So playing Fortnite, for instance, I cannot communicate with friends in my party, so I can only play it handheld. It is not bluetooth compatible with wireless headsets unless you buy a bluetooth adapter, which takes up the charging slot, so it cannot be docked, so that is useless. And a protective case is pretty much a must, because dropping the Switch (which my son has done to mine) caused one of the joycons to snap off and break and has never worked the same since, and again, the price to replace a set of joycons is just outrageous!Overall, I love my Switch. I think they are overpriced, though, as well as the games and joy cons. I feel it is a large, overpriced Gameboy. But, that said, I'd buy one again just to be able to play on the go and play the games I grew up playing (Zelda, Pokémon, etc)...

5.0,"The Future of Console Gaming
","Though I've owned every Nintendo console since the Gamecube I never really considered myself a Nintendo fan (I buy all consoles so I can get any game I want without anything being out of reach due to exclusivity). I have to say that even though the graphics aren't on par with a PS4 Pro or X-Box One X (which has XBOX as an anagram, clever), this is now my favorite system to play games on. IT  Since it is both a portable and a home console I can play my favorite games at home, during a commute, or at work (only during breaks, of course). The recently launched online service is reasonably priced at $35 per year for a family with up to 8 accounts (!!!), which is great, because I bought 3 of these during Christmas and now everyone can jump online and play together. The build quality is Nintendo standard, durable plastic. There have been a steady stream of games released with something for everyone. Playing the system docked with a Pro controller is great, just like any other current system, but being able to grab it from the dock and keep going seamlessly is what makes this system really shine.

5.0,"What the VITA should have been
","I bought the Nintendo Switch on Nov. 25th at Gamestop because of the $50 gift card offered with the new purchase.This system is excellent. I will not pretend that it is superior or close in graphics to the PS4 or XBox one; nor would I ever dare compare it to PC graphics. However, the system's portability makes it what I would say a must have.I've been playing only two games so far: Skyrim and Rayman Legends.My friends, I've been playing in bed (before or after waking up), in the bathroom, after rated R fun with the girlfriend, while in the car, while waiting at the doctor's office, and while on break during my studies.The graphics are similar to a Playstation game pushing the PS3 hardware to its maximum potential.  Just wow!I couldn't help but think this is what the PS Vita should have been if not for the greed that currently dictates Playstation corporate's every decision.Additionally, I must say that Nintendo pushes quality games versus quantity (PS and Xbox).I am very satisfied with my purchase, and would recommend this system. But be advised, if you decide to purchase this game in hopes of playing FIFA 19, my research seems to indicate that the switch version of FIFA 19 is deplorable compared to the PS4 and Xbox 1.

Keep in mind I personally selected to buy a ‘new’ not used console.1.) There were air bubbles under the screen. (No there isn’t a screen protector)2.) Markings on the back of the controllers as if someone drew on them with crayons.3.) The battery dies in one hour. (Not even joking)4.) The left thumb stick hardy responded. (It’s the main control. How can you sell a game console with a controller that doesn’t function!?!?)5.) I save the best for last. The whole console literally broke on me.

5.0,"Great but not for young kids
","This system is great for adults and teens!! I wouldn’t recommend getting a young child a $300 game system and games! They may make things like bumpers but they aren’t the highest quality!! There isn’t much protection offered!! Get the younger kids a Nintendo 2ds!! Not only are they affordable but they already have tons of kid friendly games out for it and it’s more durable and less likely to be broken while in the hands of clumsy irresponsible children!! I suggest buying a game case and putting games up as children lose everything! Not to mention the games for the 3ds and ds are much cheaper!! That being said, this system is fantastic for people who are responsible and take care of their systems!! There’s a shit ton of games out already and a lot are cheap in the e shop store online!! Much fun to be had!! I didn’t allow the kids to touch my switch or switch games even if that meant bringing it with me when I left whether it was going to be in use or not while gone!! This system is for me!! The younger ones have their own game systems!! They have Xbox 360 and Nintendo DS systems!! If they lose or break their game system they already own, it’s their loss!! I don’t believe in buying expensive game systems for children especially since kids are lazy now and all they want to do is eat, play phone or system games and veg!!! Long gone are the days where children go outside to play and ride a bike or whatever!! Now from the ages of three and four on up, they want to play with games on phones and game systems!! If you really feel the dire need to spend $400 to $500 on a spoiled child for Christmas or whatever then by all means get this sytem for them but don’t come back and complain if your child breaks it or loses everything for it! And people wonder why kids want the most expensive things for Christmas and what not these days!!! That certainly isn’t Nintendo’s fault!! Or don’t come and complain that there isn’t enough kid friendly games besides Mario odyssey and mariokart etc for it!! I will admit I like playing in portable mode the best!! I’ve honestly never played it on the tv!!

5.0,"Great Console. Great Concept. Loads of content. Lacking in Features
","To start off, I'm not one for having Netflix or Hulu on all of my devices. I could care less about watching movies on my Switch. I have plenty of other devices with those capabilities and I'm guessing the majority of people out there already do have streaming sufficient devices as well. Because of this, I can't and won't bash the console for it's lack of streaming services. As for ""features"" in my headline. I'll get to it...The console itself is an awesome concept. Countless times I've wished I could play my 3DS games on my TV. Now, the Switch takes that thought and brings it to life. Of course it doesn't play 3DS games - but the concept of playing games both portably and on the TV is what I've been waiting for and it executes perfectly in that regard. The seamlessness between handheld and docked mode is so genius that it can't be overlooked.The console is built sturdy and tough, though I do take excessively good care of my stuff and don't allow kids to touch it (I don't have kids...so that's fairly easy to accomplish). For those that have kids, I wouldn't be confident in saying that you could give this $300 machine to a kid and expect it to last. While it is built well, it's not built for kids. The 2DS is built for kids, not $300 Switch. I guess it comes down to how old your kid is and how well they take care of stuff, truthfully. But don't blame Nintendo if your 8 year old kid breaks it shortly after buying it.As for build quality, my console never overheats, though it does get alarmingly warm it seems. The ventilation seems to work well enough that it doesn't cause a problem, though for running temperature sake, I'd like to see a revision in newer Switch models with better ventilation...but that's just my opinion.Screen quality: online you'll find a lot of comparisons between the PS4/XBOXONE and the Nintendo Switch in how certain games run, look or play. Know now that the Nintendo Switch is never intended to be a competitor with the PS4 or the Xbox One. The Switch for what it is does a fantastic job when it comes to performance and graphical fidelity both in hand-held mode and docked. Is there a difference? Yes. Is it so insanely noticeable that you'll never want to play in hand-held mode? No. I played Zelda Breath of the Wild for 100+ hours all in hand-held mode sitting in the recliner while my wife watched movies on the TV. I have no regrets. Does the game look great in docked mode? Definitely. Does it look great in hand-held mode? Absolutely. Don't pay attention to the comparisons to other consoles - those people just want to complain about nit-picky things.Controllers: The joy-cons are great to use. The draw distance on the joy-sticks are a bit shallow and the buttons are a little small for most average or bigger sized hands. But they work well and are pretty comfortable. The pro controller is extremely nice and comfortable. It has an incredible build and is nice and weighty letting you know that you're holding a legit, worthy product in your hands. The battery also lasts an incredible amount of time.Games. GAMES GAMES GAMES!!!! The Switch is LOADED with games and continues to receive amazing support both on the Nintendo end and the third party end as well. Yes, the Switch is receiving some ports from the Wii U library that Nintendo believes people need to experience but it is also receiving some incredible support for new Nintendo games and loads of third party support as well as independent (indie) developers. Lack of content will never be a reason to not get a Switch. ""Lack of content"" doesn't exist on this console.Features.... again, I said streaming wasn't a factor in this and for me it isn't. But, if you ARE a streamer, you'll need to know that those types of services are not available at this time on the Switch.As for other features, there are some things to note:#1) Lack of external hard drive support. This is logical because of the inherent nature of the hand-held aspect of the console, though would still be nice to plug an external hard drive into the dock USB and transfer stuff....bringing me to #2) Inability to transfer data to storage media. The Switch does support a good sized Micro SD card for storage, though you can't transfer anything from console storage to the Micro SD card at this time. Only things that are downloaded or saved files created after installing the micro SD card are stored on the SD card. Anything prior is stored on the console unless you delete the item and re-download it. This can't be the case for saved game data - which is terrible. That is a very small thing to ask for and something the Wii U was able to do just fine. It's really disappointing and means anything you had on your Switch before picking up an SD card is essentially in jeopardy of being lost forever if your Switch breaks or corrupts. Nintendo is rolling out a Cloud Save feature soon but that's a whole separate ball of wax.#3) Virtual Console. I know Virtual Console for retro Nintendo titles is not far from streaming services - but I'd absolutely love a Virtual Console service on my Switch so I could play Gamecube games, N64 games, etc. It sounds like Nintendo MAY be doing something with this as part of their paid online service...but right now we only know about NES games...which I could care less about. #4) Achievement/Trophy system in similar fashion as to what Microsoft and Sony have done with their consoles. It really isn't that much to ask for - though Nintendo is typically WAY behind the game when it comes to giving the market what they want.I'm sure there are more features that I are missing that I'm not thinking about right now. All in all, I haven't had any major issues with my console. I take great care of it, always keep it in a heavy-duty case when transporting it and I do my best to avoid the issues that can be easily avoided.

Just those two games alone make the console worth the price.You are able to bring this to the park, friends house, across country, restroom (haha), and anywhere else as long as you can charge it!Things I hare about it:Battery life should be better for the console and controllers.Accessories are expensive.You break it you....Buy another Switch unless you just broke the dock which alone is 80$ I believe. Majority of the games should be max 40$Still lacking great multiplayer gamesNeeds more physical version games/exclusives/new ideas. So many old games from Ps3-Ps4, Xbox, etc are going out on the Switch. Also, the majority of realeases are indie games or games that you buy through the Eshop for 20$ or less!

Inside the box it's self Nintendo included everything that should have been in the box and everything was very well packaged (as if done by someone with OCD) which translated into nothing missing or broken.

","It's an interesting piece of hardware but after browsing the nintendo store, I really didn't see anything interesting. I'll be honest, I only bought this in anticipation of Smash Bros. Thankfully I bought this thing early because my left controller arrived defective so there's plenty of time to have it replaced. I'm sure there are some great games buried under the piles but I'll I've really seen are Wii U ports and the same old indie titles you can find on any other platform for probably cheaper.  After hearing such great things about the Switch, I was hoping for it to rekindle my interest in video games but instead I got a partially-broken $300 Smash Bros machine. Perhaps my view will change after I sift through more demos but so far I'm more inclined to stash the system away until December.Update;After letting the system sit unused for a few weeks, the first time I used it, the speakers on the replacement died.  Fantastic...  I had 2 stars, dropping to 1.

","Now for the most part i  enjoy the console and can say I am very glad I bought it from amazon. You see the joycon are garbage. They break so easily i am on my third set after six months of light usage. Nintendo has some nerve charging such a premium for such shoddy hardware. These thing break and literally just stop working i didn't want to leave a bad review since Amazon provided excellent customer service and replaced the first broken joycon  set i got  since they broke the first week .an since Nintendo told me it was not their problem. So in short screw Nintendo they are charging 80 bucks for shoddy controlers. Thanks to Amazon for actually caring about their consumers. But now I am On my third set of joycons and frankly considering selling the thing and buying a gpd win 2 since at this rate it would be cheaper.  Especially when you consider how all the games and accessories are so overpriced as well.

4.0,"Sturdier than it looks, cheaper than competing consoles, needs a few more games
","Controls feel smooth and surprisingly solid; I was genuinely afraid I might break the handles the first time I used it.  That said, I'm still leery of playing something like Dark Souls on the Switch where tempers can flare.  My final comment on the controls is that the handles are quite small in my hands.  If one has big hands, the standalone controller may be necessary.The hand-held mode of my unit lasted approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes from full charge.  The Switch will not replace a DS as a true mobile console with this kind of battery life.  Graphics in hand-held mode are quite good, and I much prefer it to the 3DS in that regard.The TV mode looks good, and induces no immediate complaints.  This console works well and I am happy with my purchase in that regard.  That said, I'm eagerly anticipating an expanded software library.  ""...Breath of the Wild"" is quite fun, and I've heard nothing but good things about ""...Odyssey"" (which I've yet to start) but I can't help wondering how much happier I'll be with my purchase when the new Fire Emblem, Metroid Prime, and Shin Megami Tensei games are released.

","As a console 5/5, it does what it's supposed to, play games. But if you're expecting to load videos, movies, or music on the switch this is impossible. The switch is solely a gaming console there's no web browser, netflix app, etc.There's a microsd card slot so that's great I've been making great use of that.The games are ridiculously expensive at times. Even when an indie publisher posts the game for $20ish on any other console, it'll be marked up almost 2x on the Switch. I suspect this is Nintendo's doing? I don't know how video game publishing and licensing works.The eStore is okay, barebones functionality (can't access wishlist online a website only through console). Kinda hard to browse for games tooI like how the handheld is an option but I find the console too heavy to hold up for long periods of time. Maybe I'm weak?The dock is functionally great if it'll never move. Otherwise it's a hassle to transport in a bookbag or whatever. It's slotted right? The thinner plastic side of the dock seems like it'd break with the slightest bit of accidental pressure.Third party docks have been reported to brick consoles but I'm using Insignia's Switch dock (primarily actually, barely use stock) for the last many many months with no problems. It's only $40 too.Wifi seems to be crummy on the Switch (compared to my phone or laptop located next to it). So I had to buy an ethernet adapter for the Switch dock which seemed okay. (Not all Third party ethernet adapters support the Switch so watch out).Game selection is pretty goodKinda pissed that cloud saves aren't an option yet it's been almost two years? Obviously we will have to pay for this feature for Nintendo's online service.Games can be stored on the SD card or the console, but save files are on the console only. There's no method for you to make your own backup (unless you're transfering saves/nintendo account) from one console to another.

Calling their support the only option is to spend several weeks of sending it in - waiting for them to ""inspect it"" - and then finally sending a replacement or fixed unit back. Which is great at the beginning of summer break when you bought this for your kids to waste two weeks. So I guess you can just go shell out the $80 for another joy-con instead - especially since some guys do not work without the stupid motion control piece of crap they put into it.The games are nice - the UI is good - but their customer service is designed by a moron.

3.0,"Feels like a step back from Nintendo's previous offerings
","This is definitely a 3 star system as it sits in April of 2018. If you are wondering the product works just fine. The problem is, well it doesn't feel like a complete system and well, the previous Wii U system actually has more features than this one. The console is over a year old now, so that should have been plenty of time to fix the growing pains of a new system. This system is missing a lot of features the Wii U had, its missing the camera most notably, and its missing the web browser and apps like Netflix and Youtube. Instead of transferring the Virtual Console from the Wii U so your purchases transfer, they chose just to leave out the entire Virtual console, so none of your purchases from the WIi U transfer over to this console, nor can you purchase anything from the Virtual Console on the Switch. I think Its safe to say that when buying Nintendo systems your purchases will be stuck exclusively on the console you buy them on.  This system doesn't have any apps, no web browser, no Netflix, and no Youtube, and no apps from your cable company so you can watch TV, and does almost nothing out of the box unless you insert a game cartridge or buy games from the e-shop digitally. The only app I could find is Hulu. So you don't do other things on this system, you just play games on it. The games are of course more expensive than games normally cost on other systems, on other systems games drop in price pretty fast but these do not, so for the multi-system games I will be buying those on another system for the cost savings, I think if you consume a lot of games you would probably save money by purchasing another game system or on PC if you play on PC to buy your multi-system games on instead of buying every switch game that comes out.  This system also has a lot of copies or ports of the Wii U games, which of course go back up to full price when they are re-released on the switch, often these games have a few slight upgrades like an extra character or an extra level but nothing that makes you want to pay full price for the game twice especially if you already paid for it on the Wii U. A lot of these titles are also available for way less money on the Wii U. I would say the Wii U is the better system, simply because it has more features and the games are cheaper but its not current anymore and everyone seems to well, kinda ignore it, but I don't think its really worth ignoring as its actually pretty great.So what's good about this system, its portable, you can play it in handheld mode or on your TV, but its really too big to truly be portable if you know what I mean, its not a throw in your purse like a phone kinda thing, you can carry it in your backpack or laptop bag though in case which would work nicely. You can detach the Joy-Con controllers which is nice, so you can replace them if a button breaks or it gets damaged, which you couldn't do with other systems since the controls are built in. This ensures you won't have to buy a whole new system or send it in for repair if a button stops working. This is by far the best thing about the system, and as it stands every gaming handheld going forward should have detachable controllers. It seems built a lot better than the Wii U, as the Wii U's gamepad is kind of flimsy and doesn't really stand up well to a lot of use. The dock is built fine, but the system sits loose in the dock, and yes, the dock does scratch the system, so you need to put a screen protector on the system as soon as you get it, even before inserting it into the dock the first time. The dock will also scratch the back of the system, but fortunately I put a decal on the back however, it just scratched the decal, the decal was extremely thin so I know it didn't add any bulk to the console. I had to put a piece of clear contact paper where it scratches the system, I think that will work nicely.  The battery life of the system is not great, but I haven't found a modern device yet that has adequate battery life, so that is par for the course these days,and lets face it you probably mostly play it at home, so you are never far from a charger.  The USB-C port is on the bottom of the system not the top.But lets talk about the biggest fault of this system, like the Wii U, you cannot back up your save data, so if your system dies, if it gets stolen etc, your save data is gone. If you purchase games digitally you can get them back somehow even if your console gets stolen, but your game saves will be gone, its worth knowing this before you buy and the only advice I have is to be careful with your system... or else.The E-shop... well that is an incredible mess, there is no good way to navigate it and to see what it on it.Finally, its been proven that software updates can cause certain non-official accessories like all extra docks sold for this console (unless they are made by Nintendo) to damage or brick your game console, I would be wary of any accessory or charger not made by Nintendo, because Nintendo could issue a software update that is mandatory that might make those accessories not work anymore. Of course these accessories are sold right next to the official ones in stores and sometimes its hard to tell who actually makes things so be wary when buying accessories for this system and even though these accessories are proven to not work and can cause non-repairable damage to your system they are still sold in stores and on here today.

If you break it, lose it, it fails on you, have it stolen, etc. You lose your game progress as well.  (I hear there finally was some changes to this, so please look further into it)-price-the select button is awkwardly placed, hard to hit.-dead pixels on screen.-charger is at bottom of switch.-charger for joy sticks not included.-Nintendo accounts are not fluid between all systems.-full price game downloads that do not have the same benefit as physical copies (being able to sell or share).ConclusionThe system had great potential, however, it shows everywhere that nintendo is being as proprietary as possible.  They are trying to squeeze every dollar out of you by limiting what you get out the box and what you can do in the system, to the point that transferring your games is either impossible or a major hassle.  In other words, they are aggressively trying to squeeze every last dollar out of you, while giving you as little as possible.  This is not the innovative-focused-on-fun nintendo i remember.

1.0,"It's overpriced tablet without assortment of mobile games
","I never understood the hype of this console. I brought the console through gift cards and trade credit because, I thought it was going to get more rpgs and be stable enough and fun enough to replace my new 2DS xl but the system is full of glitches. I had to go through 2 systems just to get one that worked without battery issues or charging issues. The product is built for longevity, you have to be careful with placing it in the dock or the screen will scratch and the dock is very wobbly as well so you need to be careful where you place the switch because the switch can easily fall out of the dock and break. Furthemore, you can accidently turn on the switch, just when you lightly tap the table you place the switch on because the switch isn't stable in the dock. Additionally, it is very uncomfortable through handheld mode and console mode. The handheld mode is very bulky and it was uncomfortable during long periods of play which is disappointing since Nintendo had years of experience of producing quality handhelds and the switch is just a cheap heavy tablet that you slide some joy cons on which make it bulky and uncomfortable.  The joy cons are also very fragile and can be defective, I had to go through systems since my joy cons wouldn't work brand new and the system would charge. This is terrible quality control and not worth the price of the hassle of constantly switching systems out due ot defects. The system is very overpriced with no quality games being produced.  Most of the any of the games that are not owned by Nintendo, tend to be releases of old games that you can find on other consoles for a lower price so you end up getting ripped off, paying a new price tag for an old game that would work better and be cheaper on the better consoles. There are also no deals on games, even Microsoft and Sony offer deals on their games. I personally have PlayStation plus and I have a huge library of games that I gotten free or over 50 percent discount which gives you more incentives to purchase the games and increase your digital library. Unfortunately, nintendo deals are a joke, and every part of the console that can go wrong at anytime from my experience and experience from others costs an arm and leg. If you want a pro controller for more comfortable play or replacment joy cons or even  sd card, you going to ditching out an additional 80-100 dollars. The whole experience was a disappointment and I'm just going to stick to nitnendo portable handhelds and never purchase a Nintendo console again but they never live up to the hype and always seem years behind every other console on the market. Additionally, be aware that if your console is defective than you will lose all your saves since you also need two switches working to transfer your information since it has no cloud save or even any type of internet. It doesn't even have themes like the 3DS, ps vita, and ps4 so your struck with a very dull looking interface for the switch when you only choose from black background or a grey background. This console is just not worth the price tag.  If you truly need handheld, you better off getting a Vita or new 2DS or new 3DS for a bigger selection of games and a cheaper price tag. If you want a non portable console than do yourself a favor and buy a PS4 or Xbox one since they frequently have deals on console prices with different stores and for the same price as this system or lower, you get a better system with larger storage that has a larger assortment of games that can appeal to all gamers without having to be struck with cheap overpriced Indies games, platformers, and nintendo games with the switch.

5.0,"Great game unit!
","This system is really a joy to use.  Easy to set up.  Easy to connect.  A little confusion at first, as the joycons don't come with a charger or charger cord, they charge on the unit.  Oh, and the little pieces that attach to the joycons when you use them separately... those things are easy to put on incorrectly and a total pain to get off if you do.  They do eventually come off without breaking anything, but if there's a complaint, it's there.

","Listing said this was a NEW console, the one I received is definitely not new. While it had plastic around most of the pieces when I powered on the device there was somebody else's Nintendo account already on it, along with their Wi-Fi info, and it was registered as ""Sammy G's Switch"". To make matters worse, the right joy-con will not hold a charge so it cannot be played except as a handheld. This is absolutely ridiculous. It was supposed to be Prime eligible for 2 day shipping yet it took 5 days to arrive -probably because someone at your factory was playing with it and broke it! I'm livid!

5.0,"IT HAS OPTIONS!!! OPTIONS I TELL YOU!!!
","Holy Koopa on a Bullet Bill, this is an incredible system... Bias may be in play but IS THIS AND INCREDIBLE SYSTEM!?! Yes, yes it is. Look I'm not gonna sugar coat a thing, I've been a Nintendo fan since the Super Nintendo back when I visited my Grandmother's house, always loved playing Super Mario World. And eventually I got myself a Nintendo 64 and would play Mario Kart 64 for hours. Gameboy with Super Mario Land, GameCube with Godzilla Destroy All Monsters Melee, DS with Pokemon Pearl, Wii with Godzilla Unleashed, 3DS with Super Street Fighter IV... I think you get the picture. My life has always been apart with Nintendo. I've pretty much received every system they made after the Nintendo 64. So now that I got my absolutely pointless history bias check out of the way, let's actually start discussing the Switch.First off, this honestly puts Sony to shame with their Vita. You know, the handheld system that was meant to deliver a Console experience? Seriously jokes aside, I kind of saw the Switch possibly ending up in that situation. But its marketing was actually ingenious considering how similar the Switch technically is to the Vita. The whole making the system both a Television Console and a Portable system was the ultimate selling point. This system can essentially deliver what the Vita intended to do and more. Speaking of the whole switching from TV to Portable is incredibly easy. At first I assumed I would of had to slide and ""Click"" the Switch in the dock for it to connect to the TV. Turns out all you have to do is Slide it in... no clicks at all. My guess is it's basically using the kind of technology that makes wireless chargers work. Whatever the reason, I like it. This is a system that's geared to both kids and adults. So on a children perspective, all they gotta do is just slide the system in the dock for TV or pull it out for portability.The system comes with a charging cable (that I've honestly just connected to the dock), and HDMI cable, a pair of Joycon controllers, a Joycon Grip controller, and two Joycon Straps that essentially make the Joycons become Nintendo Wii Remotes. I generally play most of the time on the Dock mode as I like to play games on the TV. So out of the control styles, my current way is the Controller grip which has you slide the Joycon in what appears to be an unfinished game controller to form a whole controller. That's literally the best way to describe it. And the Joycon are simple to remove off the Switch itself for when you wish to change the way you play. There's a locking button on each Joycon that locks into whatever it's slide into. Press and slide the Joycon off and slide onto whichever peripheral you choose which is always going to be the Grip or the Switch itself... you do not want to use the straps. Out of the peripherals you get in the box, the Straps are the worst for one simple thing. They are an absolute nightmare to get off. Getting them on isn't as hard, but removing them is an upmost hassle that I just either play the other styles. No amount of Mario Odyssey recommended play style is going to change my mind, I'm sticking to basic controllers over Wii Play style, I'm sorry Nintendo but they are not worth using if it feels like I have to break the Joycon to remove the strap. At least games will have the player receive options in terms of play style so it's not all bad. And some games even make use of the two Joycons as separate controllers. Instant Player 2. There was one other complaint I had, but no longer have. See I also like to play with my controllers always connected to a Charging cable so I don't have to worry about losing power mid-game. I can play for hours and just seeing the flashing ""Low Battery"" icon during an important moment in a game session can be... well Game Changing. See the only way to charge the Joycon without buying extra peripherals is by slotting them in the Switch. The Grip Controller you'll primarily use (like me) doesn't have a port where you can shove a mini-USB port and charge non-stop. But while researching ways to charge the Joycon, I found out something that almost makes my argument invalid. The Joycon's batteries can last around 20 hours. Now to an extent I can see people saying ""that doesn't matter, I still wanna keep my controllers charged all the time."" And that's fine, I still find it a legitimate complaint, just not one I firmly enforce. Even if I game the longest of hours which can be 10 at best, that still leaves about 50% power. And when I'm done, I simply can just slide the Joycon into the Switch itself to charge. Rather I'm going to eat, going out, or just straight up going to bed, come back and the controllers will be nice and charged for another day.I love this system and I can't wait for the library to grow. However, despite my praising, I have but two complaints I cannot let slide with Nintendo. One, Setting up Voice Chat is just an absolute mess. Why is it I NEED my phone or Tablet to talk to other players? The Wii U just required you shoving a Headphone Jack in the controller, the competitors do the exact same thing, so why all this mess? Two, there's not enough memory. Even with the Wii U where one of the system's best amount of memory was the same as the Switch being 32 GB. The competitors were and still are offering more memory than the Switch, the base PS4 system comes with 500 GB of memory. And sure, you do have a simple way of adding more memory with Micro SD Cards, but even that I can't let slide as the Wii U could use External Harddrives that could make use of 2 TB of memory. Granted, it required using at least two USB ports, but I could install more memory for the previous system, versus the current system where the highest recommended Micro SD card to use on a switch is 128 GB. GB is less than TB and it takes 1000 GB to form one TB. And in an age where Digital is becoming the norm, this was just simply a poor move.But in the end, it is a great system. It play games on the TV and on the Go. Though I would not recommend just taking your Switch anywhere without some case first, but the Switch gives you choice. Would I recommend a Switch? Oh most certainly. It may not use disc based media like Blu-Ray or HD CDs, and it actually went back to a Cartridge based system... did I not mention that? Yeah Nintendo is using cartridges like the DS and 3DS systems. Apparently they taste bad too... haven't tried it, that's just what Nintendo said. Anyways, I've said it a lot already, I love this system, it's a great system, and it's a system I will play for as long as I can. Now if Capcom could get on localizing Monster Hunter XX, that'll be even more great.

4.0,"Nintendo Switch: The Pros an Joy-Cons
","I've had a Nintendo Switch since April 2017 and it feels I'm at a point where I can give a decent review of the hardware. This review won't be influenced by the current game line-up, just my overall experience with the console itself. With that being said, let's continue with the review.Design: I think the Switch's design perfectly reflects what it's set out to do. Sliding the console inside the dock feels natural and after it locks in, It won't budge easily. However, if you're not careful, it is possible to scratch the console's screen on the dock's hard plastic shell. This hasn't happened to my console (because I immediately bought a screen protector), but I've heard from tons of buyers that it's fairly easy to scratch the console. Now, I'll tackle the dock. It's about the quality you'd expect. It's hollow and pretty light- sort of like the 3DS' charging cradle. It does it's job, though. Moving on, we have the console itself, which is essentially a tablet. Nothing really special, but attached to the back is a kickstand for playing in ""tabletop"" mode. It's a tad bit flimsy, not gonna lie. But, it won't break unless you intentionally press down on the console with all your might. Under the kickstand is a micro SD card slot, also. I'd say this placement is much better than that of the new 3DS' micro SD slot. You actually don't have to unscrew anything this time.Controllers: Your brand new Switch will come packed with two ""joycon"" controllers, two straps and a grip. The joycons are built really well, in my opinion. They fit in your hand nicely and the shell has a smooth matte finish that doesn't show fingerprints, perfect for clean freaks such as myself. The two control sticks are similar to that of a PS Vita's. They're small, but they function pretty much like traditional stick should. On your right joycon, are the traditional ABXY buttons, which are nice and clicky. The buttons are about the size of the 3DS'. The same goes for the four directional buttons on the left joycon, which take the place of a traditional d-pad. Some games like Breath of the wild use the ""d-pad"" for cycling through items. But trying to play a 2D platformer with it...eh. Next are the joycon straps. These straps slide on to each joycon and essentially make them a mini controller by adding left and right shoulder buttons. It feels a bit awkward bending your thumbs, trying to play on a controller that feels like it's meant for hamsters, but it's perfect for playing a co-op game with a buddy on the go. Next, I'll review the joycon grip. It's a hunk of plastic with two handles that you slide your joycons onto. Doing so will give you a somewhat traditional controller. Playing with the joycon grip is not bad, really. But, I still prefer the pro controller (sold separately).Other important details: I'll devote this section to things that buyers should be aware of and what they should do before buying a Switch.First, we have the screen-scratching issue that I mentioned earlier. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting a screen protector before you even attempt to slide your console into the dock, just to be safe. There are tempered glass ones right here on amazon for around 10 bucks. Some even come in packs of 2 or more.Next, we have the Switch's internal storage. The Switch is advertised to have 32 GB of internal storage, but what they don't tell you is that the console uses some of that storage for it's operating system. Thus, you will only have 25.9 GB of storage when you use your Switch for the first time. Listen carefully to what i'm about to tell you next. If you know for a fact that you'll want to be buying a lot of DIGITAL games down the road, then get yourself a micro SD card. I say 64 GB or more is ideal because the Switch is capable of running some large scale games.  And whatever you do, DON'T BUY THE NINTENDO BRAND MICRO SD CARDS. Please trust me on this. The micro SD cards with artwork of Mario and Link on them are expensive for literally no reason other than to scam unsuspecting buyers. Sandisk or any other 3rd party sells them way cheaper and with the exact same capacity. If you plan on going PHYSICAL throughout your journey with the Switch, then you'll be good for a while. Any DLC/updates should take a while to fill the 25 GB internal memory.Next is the console battery life. We all pretty much expected this, but the console battery life is around 2.5-3  hours when playing on the go. If you plan to take your console around the world and back, then I HIGHLY recommend a USB-C battery pack, which are around 50-60 bucks. If you only plan on taking it places like the dentist's office or the park, then just make sure the battery's 50% or more before leaving the house and you'll be good.Next, are controllers and chargers. The joycons charge when you slide them ONTO THE CONSOLE. Note that the grip included DOES NOT charge your joycons, but charging grips are on sale for 30 bucks. However, each joycon boasts 20 hours of battery life when fully charged, so it's really up to you whether or not a charging grip is necessary. Next, let's talk about the Switch pro controller I mentioned earlier. It is (in my opinion) the definitive way to game when your console is docked to a TV. It's a sleek, comfortable controller with larger buttons that just screams longer play sessions. It costs 70 bucks and if your wallet just cringed a bit, that's alright. But I need to tell you why it's a good investment. The pro controller offers not 10-not 20- but 40 whopping hours of battery life on a single charge. Not only that, it supports HD rumble which means....I dunno, you can feel ice cubes or something. Lastly, it has NFC support. Which means you can use all of your amiibo figurines/cards for compatible games. If you're thinking: ""When am I gonna want to feel ice cubes and play with happy meal toys?"", then I should let you know that there are cheaper 3rd party iterations of the pro controller out there that work fine, but don't have the gimmicky stuff.Lastly, we have save data. As of now, there is no way to back-up your precious game data to the cloud or an external drive. This was a feature that even the 3DS had, but for some reason, the Switch lacks. By default, your progress is saved onto the console's internal storage. But if you accidentally drop your console down the toilet, then there's no way to get it back.The verdict: the Nintendo Switch may just be the most revolutionary console in gaming history. So far, I can confirm the Switch does exactly what it's advertised to do. Any game you have can be played wherever, however and with whomever you please. So, would I say it's worth 300 bucks? Yes, simply because of it's potential. The main feature that grabs us is the portability. Just the idea of playing a large scale game wherever you want is exciting. But, I honestly feel some features like the HD rumble, IR sensor and NFC are unnecessary to the console's main selling point and only drive the price up more. Also, please understand that the Switch is not a powerhouse of a console. It's not going to get every triple A 3rd party game and with the 3rd party games it does get, they may even be worse than other versions. That's just how it is. But, the games still look great and hold up nicely compared to Xbox one and PS4. The fact that the developers crammed so much power into a tablet that's only half an inch thick, deserves a round of applause. Anyway, thanks for reading and happy gaming.

1.0,"Stopped working on Day 3.
","I gave this to my son for Christmas.  It is two days later, and the dock has stopped working.  Completely.  Nintendo's trouble-shooting page takes me through all the steps to make sure I am not an idiot who forgot to plug something in, and then says to try each part with a known working part (of course I don't have duplicate parts).  It then says the unit ""may"" need to be repaired.  I will be happy to post a more positive review, and one based more on the performance of the working unit than simply the early complete failure, but any expensive tech like this that breaks in the first week of use deserves a one-star at least for that unit.  If 99 out of a hundred units work fine, this will not adversely affect the products sales, and if half don't, then they should fail.  Hope to be back with better news after we get this fixed.  Happy holidays!

5.0,"Great Console
","I love that I can go from playing on my TV to taking it to my bedroom if someone else wants the TV. The battery life of the portable screen is good. By the time the battery is low, I usually need a break anyway, which I would say is about 3-4 hours of playing. The graphics on both the TV and the portable console are great. I got the blue and red joy-cons and I love them. I waited MONTHS for the online price to go down to the MSRP instead of shelling out the cash at a brick and mortar store for a gray joy-con one when I was lucky enough to find one. I'm glad I waited, the blue and red one is so much better looking in my opinion.
